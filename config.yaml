# This is used for timing calculations
# Since the timer counts frames, it needs to know
# the number of frames per second to get real-time values
# This value depends on the camera mode being used, e.g. HDZero 540p90
framesPerSec: 90

# This is used to mask the propellers if from the
# bottom left and right corners
# This is necessary only if the color of the props
# matches the color of a gate marker

# This is a list of gates that make up the track
# The first gate is considered to be the "Start" gate,
